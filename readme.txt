This repo contains code which I used when reading through the book, 
"Accelerated C++, Practical Programming by Example" by Andrew Koenig
and Barbara E. Moo.

I'm not sure if this could be helpful to anyone, but hopefully you can 
see how I solved the problems, or perhaps add suggestions of better ways
to complete the exercises.
